# Hover - Run Flutter apps on the desktop with hot-reload

Hover is a simple build tool to create [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) desktop applications.

**Hover is brand new and under development, it should be considered alpha. Anything can break, please backup your data before using hover**

Hover is part of the [go-flutter](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter) project. Please report issues at the [go-flutter issue tracker](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/issues/).

## Install

Hover uses [Go](https://golang.org) to build your Flutter application to desktop. Hover itself is also written using the Go language. You will need to [install go](https://golang.org/doc/install) on your development machine.

Then install hover like this:

```bash
go get -u github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover
```

If you get this error: `cmdApp.ProcessState.ExitCode undefined (type *os.ProcessState has no field or method ExitCode)`,
then update Go to at least version 1.12.

Run the same command to update when a newer version becomes available.

Install these dependencies:

* You need to make sure you have a C compiler.  
  The recommended C compiler are documented [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/InstallFromSource#install-c-tools).

* You need to make sure you have dependencies of GLFW:
	* On macOS, you need Xcode or Command Line Tools for Xcode (`xcode-select --install`) for required headers and libraries.
	* On Ubuntu/Debian-like Linux distributions, you need `libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev` packages.
	* On CentOS/Fedora-like Linux distributions, you need `libX11-devel libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel` packages.
	* See [here](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html#compile_deps) for full details.

## Getting started with an existing Flutter project

This assumes you have an existing flutter project which you want to run on desktop. If you don't have a project yet, follow the flutter tutorial for setting up a new project first.

### Init project for hover

cd into a flutter project.

```bash
cd projects/simpleApplication
```

The first time you use hover for a project, you'll need to initialize the project for desktop. An argument can be passed to `hover init` to set the project path. This is usually the path for your project on github or a self-hosted git service. _If you are unsure, use `hover init`, the generated path can always be changed later._

```bash
hover init github.com/my-organization/simpleApplication
```

This creates the directory `go` and adds boilerplate files such as Go code and a default logo.

Make sure you have the following
[main_desktop.dart](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/examples/blob/5508a59ff4916fca9c05dfde4929d8848fd2a947/pointer_demo/lib/main_desktop.dart)
in the root librairie of your application.  
It's the following code before `runApp(..)` that makes Flutter run on other platforms:
```dart
debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride = TargetPlatform.fuchsia;
```


Optionally, you may add [plugins](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/plugins) to `go/cmd/options.go`  
Optionally, change the logo in `go/assets/logo.png`, which is used as icon for the window.


### Run with hot-reload

To run the application and attach flutter for hot-reload support:

```bash
hover run
```

The hot-reload is manual because you'll need to press 'r' in the terminal to hot-reload the application.

By default, hover uses the file `lib/main_desktop.dart` as entrypoint. You may specify a different endpoint by using the `--target` flag.

If you want to integrate go-flutter with VSCode, read this [issue](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/issues/129#issuecomment-513590141).

### Build standalone application

To create a standalone release (JIT mode) build run this command:

```bash
hover build linux # or darwin or windows
```
You can create a build for any of the supported OSs using cross-compiling which needs [Docker to be installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
Then just run the command from above and it will do everything for you.

The output will be in `go/build/outputs/linux` or windows or darwin.

To start the binary: (replace `yourApplicationName` with your app name)

```bash
./go/build/outputs/linux/yourApplicationName
```

It's possible to zip the whole dir `go/build/outputs/linux` and ship it to a different machine.

### Packaging
You can package your application for different packaging formats.  
First initialize the packaging format:
```bash
hover init-packaging linux-appimage
```
Update the configuration files located in `go/packaging/linux-appimage/`to your needs.  
Then create a build and package it using this command:
```bash
hover build linux-appimage
```
The packaging output will be located in `go/build/outputs/linux-appimage/`

To get a list of all available packaging formats run:
```bash
hover build --help
```

## Fonts

No text visible? Make sure to use fonts who are included in the flutter assets/fonts system. The default font for `MaterialApp`, Roboto, is not installed on all machines.
